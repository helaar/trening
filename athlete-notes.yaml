  cycling_sessions:
    base_endurance: |
      Long sessions (2-3.5h) at 155-180W (60-70% FTP). Fatmax structure or pure steady state. 
      Measures cardiac drift as quality indicator - aims for <5% over 3 hours. High cadence focus (85-95 rpm).
    
    quality_ftp: |
      Development sessions with mix of 90-100% FTP in various formats. Over-under structures (e.g. 175W/190W/205W) 
      or threshold steady-state. Uses cadence variations consciously - both high cadence and strength focus.
    
    vo2_anaerobic: |
      Shorter intervals like 40/20, 30/15 or 3x10x40/20. Focus on neuromuscular power and 
      lactate tolerance. Alternates between seated and standing pedaling. RPE 6-7 as target.

    commuting: |
      Commutes by bike aproximately 6 km each way most of the year. Morning ride identified
      by low intensity (mostly down hill/flat). Afternoon/Evening ride identified by more
      intensity (flat/up hill 175 m elevation gain)

  running_sessions:
    base: |
      1 hour conversational pace (6:20-7:00/km) on treadmill or outdoors. 290-320W running power, heart rate in Z1-Z2. 
      Focus on aerobic capacity and variation from cycling. Often Monday/Tuesday as active recovery.
    
    intervals: |
      4x4 min VO2max or hill repetitions. Running power 390-470W, heart rate rarely above 165 bpm. 
      Uses both treadmill (control) and outdoor terrain (specificity). 1x/week through winter.

    commuting: |
      Will choose to run to work in winter on snowy conditions. Will be identified as a Morning
      run on low intensity down hill 2 km and flat 2.5 km. Using the bus to get home :)

  strength: |
    Two fixed sessions per week: leg focus (squats, deadlifts, step-ups, Bulgarian split squats) and 
    upper body/core (cybex row, chest press, torso rotation, lat pulldown, leg raises, leg press). 
    Heart rate deliberately kept low (<100 bpm rest, <85 bpm work) for minimal interference with 
    endurance training. RPE 2-3, focus on activation and injury prevention.

  periodization: |
    Off-season (winter): Base building with high cycling volume, maintenance of running capacity, 
    consistent strength training. Build phase (spring): Increasing intensity and specificity toward L'Étape. 
    Peak phase (summer): Sharp sessions and tapering. Flexible adaptation based on form and life situation.
