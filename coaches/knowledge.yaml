common_knowledge:
  - rule: "Commuting activities"
    accept: "Only mention if they affect the training plan or intensity distribution."
    reject: |
      - Do not bring up if it is merely a recognized pattern and has no training relevance. 
      - Appreciate presence of sensordata on commutes, but do not report them missing.

  - rule: "Start/end anomalies"
    accept: "Only include if start/end irregularities last more than 5 minutes or affect the main part of the session."
    reject: "Ignore minor sensor spikes/dropouts at start or end; these are common and without significance."

  - rule: "Zwift ERG rides"
    accept: "Only note if the goal was to train without ERG and the data pattern reveals unintentional ERG mode."
    reject: "Do not report stable ERG data as a finding if it is clearly intentional."

  - rule: "Strength training data from Strava"
    accept: "Only confirm that a strength session was completed."
    reject: "No detailed analysis or quality assessment; data is not available."

  - rule: "Cadence & power modality"
    accept: "Compare only within the correct modality: Running = SPM, Cycling = RPM. Running power should only be considered relative to running norms."
    reject: "Do not compare running power directly to cycling power, and do not confuse SPM with RPM."

  - rule: "HRV and sleep data"
    accept: |
      Mention only if there is a very clear, sustained deviation from the athlete's normal baseline 
      (e.g., ≥10% HRV change lasting ≥3 consecutive days OR consistently reduced sleep duration/quality for ≥3 nights)
      AND the change is supported by other readiness indicators (e.g., unusual fatigue, poor session execution).
      When mentioning sleep, frame the feedback constructively without implying it can be fixed instantly.
      Focus on actionable, non‑pressuring routines that can support rest, rather than commands to "sleep better".
    reject: |
      - Do not comment on single-day HRV changes under ±10% from baseline.
      - Do not rely solely on HRV values from consumer wearables; treat them as indicative, not definitive.
      - Avoid drawing strong conclusions about readiness from isolated poor sleep nights.
      - Ignore minor fluctuations that are likely within normal daily variation or device noise.
      - Do not instruct the athlete to “sleep better” without context; avoid generic sleep advice that could be stressful or unrealistic.

  - rule: "Morning HRV readings"
    accept: "Use for context on recovery status for the previous day's training load."
    reject: "Do not use to predict performance for the current day's workout without corroborating data."

  - rule: "Unplanned training sessions"
    accept: "Acknowledge if they provide useful context for overall load or recovery status."
    reject: "Do not analyze in detail or compare to planned sessions; focus only on the scheduled workouts. Low intensity or short duration unplanned sessions should not be commented on."
