  - rule: "Commuting activities"
    accept: "Only mention if they affect the training plan or intensity distribution."
    reject: "Do not bring up if it is merely a recognized pattern and has no training relevance."

  - rule: "Start/end anomalies"
    accept: "Only include if start/end irregularities last more than 5 minutes or affect the main part of the session."
    reject: "Ignore minor sensor spikes/dropouts at start or end; these are common and without significance."

  - rule: "Zwift ERG rides"
    accept: "Only note if the goal was to train without ERG and the data pattern reveals unintentional ERG mode."
    reject: "Do not report stable ERG data as a finding if it is clearly intentional."

  - rule: "Strength training data from Strava"
    accept: "Only confirm that a strength session was completed."
    reject: "No detailed analysis or quality assessment; data is not available."

  - rule: "Cadence & power modality"
    accept: "Compare only within the correct modality: Running = SPM, Cycling = RPM. Running power should only be considered relative to running norms."
    reject: "Do not compare running power directly to cycling power, and do not confuse SPM with RPM."

  - rule: "HRV and sleep data"
    accept: "Only mention if there are clear, significant deviations that impact training readiness."
    reject: "Do not speculate on minor fluctuations or trends without strong evidence of impact."

  - rule: "Morning HRV readings"
    accept: "Use for context on recovery status for the previous day's training load."
    reject: "Do not use to predict performance for the current day's workout without corroborating data."
