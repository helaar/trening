    age: 50+
    gender: male
    location: Trondheim, Norway
    preferred_laguage: Norwegian
    experience: Amateur, excerciser. Started training on regular basis aproximately 10 years ago. 
    main_focus: Cycling (road)
    sports: Cycling (main), running (for fun), cross country skiing (winter), swiming and hiking(for fun)
    
  training_philosophy: |
    Structured and data-driven approach focusing on both objective numbers and subjective experience. 
    Balances training enjoyment with targeted progression. Uses technology actively, but always lets 
    bodily signals and RPE weigh heavily in decisions. Values consistency and long-term development 
    over short-term performances. Motivated by measureable progress.

  capacity:
    weekly hours: 12-18
    weekly_tss: 600 (off season) to 900-1100 (peak season)
    annual_hours: 600-800
 
    sleep: 6.5-8 hours/night (workdays)
    resting_heart_rate: 49-51 bpm (normal range)  

  primary_goals:
    main: L'Étape Trondheim 2026 (130 km, 1500+ meters elevation)
    secondary: Robust cycling/running engine, running competitions as variation
    long_term: Maintain and develop endurance capacity and strength into older age

  technical_approach: |
    Advanced data collection and analysis with custom scripts for detailed workout review. 
    Combines TrainingPeaks, Strava, Zwift and own analysis tools. Distinguishes between cycling-FTP (260W) 
    and running-FTP (365W) for precise TSS/IF calculations. Uses ERG mode actively for controlled 
    intensity and comparable sessions over time.

  measurement_devices: [Garmin Fenix8 Solar,Garmin Edge 530 and 840,Garmin Rally 200, TacX Neo T2, 4iii power meter, Garmin HRM Dual]
  equipment: 
    - Road bike: | 
        Canyon Ultimate CF SL 8 Aero:
        Used with Garmin Rally 200 dual-sided power meter pedals during outdoor rides. 
        Mounted on TacX Neo T2 smart trainer for indoor sessions.
    - Gravel bike: |

    - Winter bike: |      
        White mountain bike with studded tires:
        Used for winter commuting and occasional off-road training.
        Outdoor rides only, no power meter.

    Social:
    - July 2025: Bikepacking trip Helsinki - Malmö 3200 km (completed in 19 days)

  strengths_and_characteristics: |
    Excellent aerobic economy - delivers same work with lower heart rate burden over time. Good ability 
    to hold steady intensity over long sessions (minimal VI on ERG, low cardiac drift). Technical 
    improvement in cadence control - from ~78 rpm to ~87-90 rpm on base sessions. Analytical approach 
    with ability to connect subjective experiences with objective data. Balanced training understanding 
    that avoids over-analysis of individual values.


      
  mental_aspects: |
      Views training enjoyment and load management as equally important as watts and VO2max. Listens to the body 
      and adjusts plan with heavy legs, stress or poor sleep. Uses data as a tool, not a straitjacket. 
      Values long-term progression and has patience to build form gradually.
      Could improve self confidence in training and racing situations. Need to trust training more and avoid
      second-guessing based on minor data fluctuations.

  development_areas: |
    Continue cadence optimization on cycling, especially under fatigue in long sessions. Maintain 
    running capacity through winter without compromising cycling specificity. 
    Balance technical data analysis with intuition and bodily signals.

  weather: |
    - Outdoor traing season starts around easter and lasts to mid/end september. 
    - Running is  preferred off season (mid august to outdoor season starts). 
    - Skiing will be preferred  on good weather conditions and should only be used as bonus-exercises.
