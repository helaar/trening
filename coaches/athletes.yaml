Helge:
  basics:
    age: 50+
    gender: male
    location: Trondheim, Norway
    preferred_laguage: Norwegian
    experience: Amateur, excerciser. Started training on regular basis aproximately 10 years ago. 
    main_focus: Cycling (road)
    sports: Cycling (main), running (for fun), cross country skiing (winter), swiming and hiking(for fun)
    
  training_philosophy: |
    Structured and data-driven approach focusing on both objective numbers and subjective experience. 
    Balances training enjoyment with targeted progression. Uses technology actively, but always lets 
    bodily signals and RPE weigh heavily in decisions. Values consistency and long-term development 
    over short-term performances. Motivated by measureable progress.

  primary_goals:
    main: L'Étape Trondheim 2026 (130 km, 1500+ meters elevation)
    secondary: Robust cycling/running engine, running competitions as variation
    long_term: Maintain and develop endurance capacity

  technical_approach: |
    Advanced data collection and analysis with custom scripts for detailed workout review. 
    Combines TrainingPeaks, Strava, Zwift and own analysis tools. Distinguishes between cycling-FTP (260W) 
    and running-FTP (365W) for precise TSS/IF calculations. Uses ERG mode actively for controlled 
    intensity and comparable sessions over time.

  measurement_devices: [Garmin Fenix8 Solar,Garmin Edge 530 and 840,Garmin Rally 200, TacX Neo T2, 4iii power meter, Garmin HRM Dual]
  
  strengths_and_characteristics: |
    Excellent aerobic economy - delivers same work with lower heart rate burden over time. Good ability 
    to hold steady intensity over long sessions (minimal VI on ERG, low cardiac drift). Technical 
    improvement in cadence control - from ~78 rpm to ~87-90 rpm on base sessions. Analytical approach 
    with ability to connect subjective experiences with objective data. Balanced training understanding 
    that avoids over-analysis of individual values.

  typical_training_week:
    structure: "1-2 hard cycling sessions, 1 running interval, 1-2 strength, 2+ base sessions"
    volume: "10-12 hours including commuting"
    tss_target: "350-450 TSS/week in off-season"
    
  cycling_sessions:
    base_endurance: |
      Long sessions (2-3.5h) at 155-180W (60-70% FTP). Fatmax structure or pure steady state. 
      Measures cardiac drift as quality indicator - aims for <5% over 3 hours. High cadence focus (85-95 rpm).
    
    quality_ftp: |
      Development sessions with mix of 90-100% FTP in various formats. Over-under structures (e.g. 175W/190W/205W) 
      or threshold steady-state. Uses cadence variations consciously - both high cadence and strength focus.
    
    vo2_anaerobic: |
      Shorter intervals like 40/20, 30/15 or 3x10x40/20. Focus on neuromuscular power and 
      lactate tolerance. Alternates between seated and standing pedaling. RPE 6-7 as target.

    commuting: |
      Commutes by bike aproximately 6 km each way most of the year. Morning ride identified
      by low intensity (mostly down hill/flat). Afternoon/Evening ride identified by more
      intensity (flat/up hill 175 m elevation gain)

  running_sessions:
    base: |
      1 hour conversational pace (6:20-7:00/km) on treadmill or outdoors. 290-320W running power, heart rate in Z1-Z2. 
      Focus on aerobic capacity and variation from cycling. Often Monday/Tuesday as active recovery.
    
    intervals: |
      4x4 min VO2max or hill repetitions. Running power 390-470W, heart rate rarely above 165 bpm. 
      Uses both treadmill (control) and outdoor terrain (specificity). 1x/week through winter.

    commuting: |
      Will choose to run to work in winter on snowy conditions. Will be identified as a Morning
      run on low intensity down hill 2 km and flat 2.5 km. Using the bus to get home :)

  strength: |
    Two fixed sessions per week: leg focus (squats, deadlifts, step-ups, Bulgarian split squats) and 
    upper body/core (cybex row, chest press, torso rotation, lat pulldown, leg raises, leg press). 
    Heart rate deliberately kept low (<100 bpm rest, <85 bpm work) for minimal interference with 
    endurance training. RPE 2-3, focus on activation and injury prevention.

  periodization: |
    Off-season (winter): Base building with high cycling volume, maintenance of running capacity, 
    consistent strength training. Build phase (spring): Increasing intensity and specificity toward L'Étape. 
    Peak phase (summer): Sharp sessions and tapering. Flexible adaptation based on form and life situation.

  mental_aspects: |
    Views training enjoyment and load management as equally important as watts and VO2max. Listens to the body 
    and adjusts plan with heavy legs, stress or poor sleep. Uses data as a tool, not a straitjacket. 
    Values long-term progression and has patience to build form gradually.

  development_areas: |
    Continue cadence optimization on cycling, especially under fatigue in long sessions. Maintain 
    running capacity through winter without compromising cycling specificity. 
    Balance technical data analysis with intuition and bodily signals.

  weather: |
    - Outdoor traing season starts around easter and lasts to mid/end september. 
    - Running is  preferred off season (mid august to outdoor season starts). 
    - Skiing will be preferred  on good weather conditions and should only be used as bonus-exercises.
