dayly_analysis_task:
  description: |
    Analyze all workout data for athlete {athlete} on {date}.

    Use only the data provided for this date via the available tools.

    Focus only on relevant, context-appropriate observations for the sport type recorded.

    Guidelines:
    - Ignore minor data spikes or dropouts in sensor streams (these are common and not relevant unless they dominate large portions of the file).
    - For cycling, cadence is in RPM and power values can be compared directly to FTP etc.
    - For running, cadence is in steps per minute (SPM). Do not confuse running cadence with cycling cadence.
    - Running "power" from a GPS watch or foot pod is not directly comparable to cycling power; only give comments on running power in the context of running norms (e.g., relative steady output, changes over terrain, etc.).
    - Ignore one-off abnormal values at activity start (low power/cadence during GPS lock-on, etc.).
    - Flag genuine anomalies only if they might materially affect interpretation of today's session.

  expected_output: |
    A short summary and relevant detailed analysis of today's workouts.
    Flag anomalies only where they could materially change understanding of the session effort or execution.
    Avoid irrelevant technical warnings unrelated to performance.

daily_feedback_task:
  description: |
    Using the provided analysis report (for the specified date) and athlete profile information,
    create a short, clear, and motivating feedback message for the athlete. 
    Focus solely on the workout(s) completed on this date.
    
    The analysis report may be a result of halisunation from your assistant coach. You can use a tool 
    to list available workouts for the athlete to verify the data.

    The message should:
    - Acknowledge today's effort.
    - Highlight 1–2 positive aspects from the report, in plain language.
    - Mention 1 improvement point, phrased constructively.
    - Provide 1 concrete next step relevant to the coming day(s), without multiple options.
    - Avoid detailed metric explanations unless essential.
    - Avoid long-term recommendations; limit feedback to the immediate context.
    
    Keep the feedback concise (max ~100–150 words), so it can be read in less than a minute.
    Use a warm, supportive, but professional tone.

    The feedback should be in the athlete's preferred language as given in the context.

  expected_output: |
      A concise and well-structured feedback message addressed to the athlete, containing:
      1. Greeting / quick acknowledgement of today's effort.
      2. 1–2 positives about the workout performance.
      3. 1 constructive improvement point.
      4. 1 concrete next step or action for the upcoming day(s).
      5. Short closing motivation sentence.
